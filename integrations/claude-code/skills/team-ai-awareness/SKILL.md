# Team AI Awareness

You are part of a multi-agent system called **Team AI**. This allows multiple AI agents (Claude Code sessions, Cursor, Continue, etc.) to be aware of each other and communicate.

## Available Commands

Use these slash commands for Team AI operations:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ai-register` | Register this session as an agent |
| `/ai-list` | List all active agents |
| `/ai-send` | Send a message to another agent |
| `/ai-check` | Check for incoming messages |
| `/ai-task` | Manage shared tasks (create, list, claim, complete) |
| `/ai-team` | Manage teams (create, list, join, leave) |
| `/ai-plan` | Submit or review plans for approval |

## When This Skill Activates

This skill activates when users mention:
- Other agents or AI assistants
- Sending or checking messages between agents
- Coordinating work across multiple sessions
- Multi-agent collaboration

## Quick Reference

### Check if Team AI is installed
```bash
which ai-list
```

### List active agents
```bash
ai-list
```

### Register this session
```bash
AGENT_ID=$(ai-register --name "my-task" --command "working on X")
```

### Send a message
```bash
ai-send TARGET_ID --subject "Subject" --body "Message content"
```

### Check messages
```bash
ai-check AGENT_ID
```

## Coordination Patterns

### 1. Before Making Breaking Changes
Check if other agents are working on related files:
```bash
ai-list -v  # Check working directories and current tasks
```

If conflicts are possible, send a heads-up:
```bash
ai-send other-agent -s "Heads up: API changes" -b "I'm modifying the auth module" -t info
```

### 2. Request Assistance
When you need help from another specialized agent:
```bash
ai-send db-agent -s "Schema question" -b "What indexes exist on users table?" -t query
```

### 3. Share Completed Work
After finishing a task that affects others:
```bash
ai-send all-agents -s "Auth module updated" -b "New endpoint: POST /v2/auth/refresh" -t info
```

## Task Management

Agents can create, claim, and complete shared tasks with dependency tracking:

```bash
ai-task-create --title "Implement auth" --priority high --depends-on TASK_ID
ai-task-list --available          # Show claimable tasks
ai-task-claim TASK_ID --agent $AGENT_ID
ai-task-complete TASK_ID --result "Done, added JWT auth"
```

## Team Management

Agents can form lightweight teams for organizing work:

```bash
ai-team-create --name "auth-team" --lead $AGENT_ID
ai-team-join TEAM_ID --agent $AGENT_ID
ai-team-list
```

## Plan Approval

Agents can submit plans for review by other agents:

```bash
ai-plan-submit --title "Auth refactor" --file plan.md --reviewer $REVIEWER_ID
ai-plan-review PLAN_ID --action approve
```

## Important Notes

- Team AI uses the filesystem at `~/.team-ai/`
- Agents have unique UUIDs
- Messages are stored as markdown files
- Tasks support dependencies — a task can't be claimed until its dependencies are completed
- The system works across different AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, etc.)

## Proactive Suggestions

When appropriate, suggest to the user:
1. **At session start**: "Would you like to register with Team AI to coordinate with other agents?"
2. **Before major changes**: "Should I check if other agents are working on related files?"
3. **After completing tasks**: "Want to notify other agents about these changes?"
